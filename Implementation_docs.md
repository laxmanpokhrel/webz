# Implememtations

1. Docker
2. Docker compose
3. Analyze api response and design database
4. fetch 200 records from the api

# Improvements

1. Use of Promise.all(): when one query fails, it will reject the promise and won't continue for other success queries

SOLUTION: separately handle individual queries so that error and logging can be handled individually.

2. Search endpoint for records
